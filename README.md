# 🚨 Network Intrusion Detection using XGBoost, SMOTE, and SHAP

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline to detect **infiltration traffic** within a network, leveraging **XGBoost** for classification, **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance, and **SHAP** for model interpretability.

## 🔍 Project Overview

In the realm of network security, infiltration events are rare but critical. This project focuses on building a **binary classifier** to detect infiltration attempts using traffic features. The model was trained and tested on a subset of a real-world intrusion detection dataset.

## 🧪 Techniques Used

- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting algorithm for high-performance classification.
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**: Applied to balance the dataset and improve recall on the minority class (infiltration).
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: Used to interpret the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions.
